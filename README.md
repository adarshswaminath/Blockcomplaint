# Blockchain-Based Complaint Registration System

This project aims to provide a secure and transparent complaint registration system using blockchain technology. Users can register their complaints and update the complaint status from pending to resolved. The system is built using React.Js & TailwindCss, Foundry, and Thirdweb.
Features

    Complaint registration: Users can register their complaints by providing necessary details such as complaint description, category, and date of occurrence.
    Complaint status update: Users can update the status of their complaints from pending to resolved. This feature ensures that users are informed about the progress of their complaints.
    Secure: The use of blockchain technology ensures that the data is secure and tamper-proof. Only the complaint registered wallet can change the complaint status, ensuring that the process is secure.
    Transparency: Anyone can search for complaints using the wallet address, but personal data is not visible. The searcher can only see the complaint ID, complaint description, complaint registered time, response from the admin, response time, and the complaint status.
    Admin Panel: The admin authentication is based on the wallet, so only the owner can access the admin dashboard. The admin dashboard has four tabs:
        Total complaints: This tab shows the total number of complaints registered in the system.
        Last Responded Complaint ID: This tab shows the last responded complaint ID by the admin.
        Respond: This tab allows the admin to respond to the complaints registered in the system.
        Status Updated Complaints: This tab shows the complaints whose status has been updated by the admin.
